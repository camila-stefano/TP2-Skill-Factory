## **💻 Skill Factory - Checkpoint 2.** - **React JS.**

---

The assignment for this project (**C2**) was to migrate [our first project](https://github.com/avilalte/TP1-Skill-Factory) (**C1**) to a React SPA.

This is a brief description of **C1**:

> _The goal was to create a site with 3 pages which would contain in no specific order: a contact form, a users table, and a set of cards displaying information about Rick and Morty characters._
>
> _For the last two pages the data was fetched from different APIs using **Axios**. Styles were applied using vanilla **CSS**._

---

### Features

- **Form page** where you can enter your info and send a message. _Handled with `React Hook Form`_.
- **Users page** that displays a table with fake users data from [this API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). _Fetched with `Axios`_.
- **Rick and Morty page** where you can see all the characters from R&M with details like `species`, `birth planet`, `status` (_dead or alive_), and a picture of them. You can also search by name, which will show you all the variants each character has had throughout the show.

#### The following dependencies were used for **C2**:

- Axios.
- React.
- React DOM.
- React Router DOM.
